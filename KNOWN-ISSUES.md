**Version**: v24.9.1

## Critical Issues

### 1. Message Synchronization Partially Working

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: üîÑ PARTIALLY FIXED (70% working) - Task 7.5 pending  
**Affected**: All users

**Description**:
Message sync from mobile devices to desktop is partially working. Sync requests succeed, but data transfer fails.

**What Works**:

- ‚úÖ Sync can be triggered without crashes
- ‚úÖ Desktop sends sync request to mobile
- ‚úÖ Mobile receives request and prepares backup
- ‚úÖ Mobile sends backup to server
- ‚úÖ Real-time messaging works perfectly

**What Doesn't Work**:

- ‚ùå Desktop fails to download backup from server
- ‚ùå Message history doesn't sync
- ‚ùå Offline messages don't sync

**Root Cause**:

- ‚úÖ Fixed: Initialization issue (Task 7.1-7.4)
- ‚ùå Remaining: Data transfer fails at download stage

**Possible Causes of Data Transfer Failure**:

- Server-side restriction for Linux clients
- Network/firewall blocking data transfer
- Encryption/decryption key mismatch
- File system permission issues

**Impact**:

- ‚ùå Cannot sync message history from mobile to desktop
- ‚ùå Messages received on mobile while desktop is offline won't sync
- ‚úÖ Real-time messaging works perfectly when app is open
- ‚úÖ Messages sent from desktop work normally

**Workarounds**:

1. Use mobile app to access full message history
2. Keep desktop app open for real-time messages
3. Use Zalo web version as alternative

**Progress**:

- Task 7.1: ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging
- Task 7.2: ‚úÖ Identified initialization issue
- Task 7.3: ‚úÖ Fixed initialization (forced init in constructor)
- Task 7.4: ‚úÖ Verified sync request works
- Task 7.5: ‚è≥ PENDING - Fix data transfer failure

**Technical Details**: See `TASK-7-MESSAGE-SYNC-COMPLETE.md`

**Next Steps**:

- Add logging to download/decrypt states
- Monitor network traffic with Wireshark
- Check file system permissions
- Investigate encryption key handling
