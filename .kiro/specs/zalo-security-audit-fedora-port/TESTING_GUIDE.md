## How to Test

### 1. Check Your Display Server

Run this command to see if you're on Wayland or X11:
```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

Output will be either `wayland` or `x11`.

### 2. Launch Zalo

Use any of the launch methods above.

### 3. Test Window Controls

Once Zalo is running:

1. **Minimize Test:**
   - Click the minimize button (usually `-` or `_`)
   - Window should minimize to taskbar
   - Click taskbar icon to restore

2. **Maximize Test:**
   - Click the maximize button (usually `‚ñ°`)
   - Window should fill the screen
   - Click again to restore to previous size

3. **Close Test:**
   - Click the close button (usually `√ó`)
   - Application should close gracefully

4. **Drag Test:**
   - Click and hold on the titlebar
   - Move mouse to drag window
   - Release to drop window in new position

5. **Resize Test:**
   - Move cursor to window corner (cursor should change to resize icon)
   - Click and drag to resize window
   - Try all four corners
   - Try all four edges

### 4. Compare with Original

If you want to compare with the original (unpatched) behavior:

```bash
# Restore original file
cp ~/.local/share/Zalo/Zalo/app/main-dist/main.js.backup ~/.local/share/Zalo/Zalo/app/main-dist/main.js

# Launch and test
~/.local/share/Zalo/start.sh

# Restore patched version
cp ~/Github/zalo-linux/original/ZaloZaDark/Zalo/app/main-dist/main.js ~/.local/share/Zalo/Zalo/app/main-dist/main.js
```

---

## Expected Results

### Before Patch (Original)
- ‚ùå No window controls visible on Wayland
- ‚ùå Cannot minimize, maximize, or close window
- ‚ùå Titlebar not draggable
- ‚ùå Application essentially unusable on Wayland

### After Patch (Current)
- ‚úÖ Native window controls visible
- ‚úÖ Minimize, maximize, close buttons work
- ‚úÖ Titlebar is draggable
- ‚úÖ Window is fully functional on Wayland
- ‚úÖ Window is fully functional on X11

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Application won't launch

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Electron is installed correctly
ls -la ~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/

# Check chrome-sandbox permissions
ls -la ~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/chrome-sandbox

# Should show: -rwsr-xr-x 1 root ...
# If not, run:
sudo chown root ~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 ~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/chrome-sandbox
```

### Issue: Python tray error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
sudo dnf install -y python3-pystray python3-pillow
```

### Issue: Window controls still not working

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify patch was applied
cd ~/Github/zalo-linux
node -e "const fs = require('fs'); const code = fs.readFileSync('original/ZaloZaDark/Zalo/app/main-dist/main.js', 'utf8'); console.log(code.includes('frame:\"linux\"===process.platform') ? '‚úÖ Patch applied' : '‚ùå Patch not applied');"

# If patch not applied, re-run:
node patch-window-frame.js
./install-patched-zalo.sh
```

### Issue: Want to see console output

**Solution:**
```bash
# Launch from terminal to see console output
~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/electron ~/.local/share/Zalo/Zalo/app
```
