## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Changed

// Before (Original)
frame: false,  // Frameless window (broken on Wayland)

// After (Patched)
frame: process.platform === 'linux',  // Native frame on Linux
```

- python3-pillow
- wget

---

## 📝 Installation Notes

### Fedora Users

The installer uses `dnf` to install Python dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3-pystray python3-pillow
```

### Ubuntu/Debian Users

The installer uses `apt` to install Python dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pystray python3-pil
```

### Other Distributions

The installer falls back to `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install pystray pillow --break-system-packages
```

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### chrome-sandbox Permissions

The installer sets proper permissions for chrome-sandbox:

```bash
sudo chown root ~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 ~/.local/share/Zalo/electron-v22.3.27-linux-x64/chrome-sandbox
```

This is required for Electron's sandbox to work correctly.
